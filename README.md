# Generalization Atari DQN
This repository contains the implementation used in my [MsC](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/kisa/aurkezpena) degree dissertation.

The aim is to study if the knowledge from CNN and Dense layers can be leveraged in order to transfer previous experiences into new environments.

## Python version

These experiments are coded in [Python2](https://www.python.org/). Please, use the correct version of this programming language 
before testing the code.


## How to install
 
To use this experimentation files you need to install the following Python 
packages:

* Keras
* Tensorflow
