# Generalization Atari DQN
This repository contains the implementation used in my MsC degree dissertation.

The idea is to study if the knowledge from CNN and Dense layer 
can be leveraged in order to transfer previous experiences into new environments.

## Python version

These experiments are coded in [Python2](https://www.python.org/). Please, use the correct version of the language 
before testing the code.


## How to install
 
To use this experimentation files you need to install the following Python 
packages:

* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Matplotlib
* OpenAIGym
